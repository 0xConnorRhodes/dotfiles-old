Inspired by https://github.com/tom-on-the-internet/sticky-notes but modified by Connor Rhodes to work a different way.

MOD+F12 brings up an alacritty terminal with no prompt (thanks to the custom .bashrc) that looks like a sticky note. It has a custom window class of "sticky-note" allowing the user to define window rules to make it floating or appear on all desktops. The user can type whatever they want into the window as a reminder.

The differences between this and the original project are:
1. In this version you launch the sticky note and then type your note
2. All the relevant files are located in the same directory
