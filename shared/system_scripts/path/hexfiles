# shell script to convert filenames in hexadecimal to ascii characters.
# useful for iwd filenames encoded in hex.
# The included regex matches filenames that begin with any character and 
# end with any extension but contain only hex characters in the middle.
# The script presents the ascii filenames with fzf for user selection
# and then outputs the hex filename corresponding to that choice.
#
# You can use this script in a shell alias such as: vhex='vim $(hexfiles)'
